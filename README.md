# Lab 8: Starting your Group Project

#### Step 1:
- Get into your project groups

#### Step 2: First Pull Request
- Create a repo on github on one of the user's accounts, with an initial README
- Have everyone clone the repo
- Have one person pullrequest the following into the README.MD
- Have another person comment "Looks great!" and merge it in

```
# Our Project is Awesome
By: Person1, Person2, Person3, Person 4
```

#### Step 3: Conflicts
- Designate each team member to be Person1, Person2, etc.
- Have everyone submit a pull request, without merging, with their name replacing Person1, Person2, etc.
- As soon as there are 4 PRs (or less if you have less members) merge in the changes one by one.
- Fix conflicts as they come up!


#### Quick Git Commands:
```
git add -A 
git commit -m "commit message"
git branch branch-name
git checkout branch-name
git pull origin master
git push -u origin HEAD
git status
git log

If you need to know what these commands do, google search them! And if still confusing, ask one of the TAs for help
